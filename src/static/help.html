    <h2>Embedded Connectivity Appliance</h2>
    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>You can control the status of radios in the technology form. By default all the radios are ON. If you want to turn all radios OFF, you can set <i>Flight mode</i> ON.
    <p>The <i>Wired</i> technology refers to ethernet devices in the host.
    <p>The <i>Wifi</i> technology refers to wireless lan devices found in the host.
    <p>The <i>Cellular</i> technology refers to 3G modems found in the host.
    <p>The <i>Bluetooth</i> technology refers to all Bluetooth devices found in the host.
    <h3>Tethering</h3>
    <p>The tethering form allows you to activate tethering i.e., access network
      resources via this host.
    <p>By activating Wlan tethering, you are creating a Wifi access point
      with given SSID (network identifier). If you connect to this
      tethering access point using your mobile device, you can access wired,
      bluetooth or cellular networks from you mobile phone or other mobile
      device.
      <br>Note that once the AP has been created, it cannot be removed.
      You are only allowed to turn Wlan tethering ON or OFF after that.
    <p>Ethernet tethering e.g., connecting your laptop to this host via
      ethernet and accessing cellular, wifi or bluetooth networks is not yet
      supported.
    <p>Bluetooth tethering allows you to create a bluetooth access point
      and access network resources via your bluetooth enabled mobile phone.
      You must pair the other device before you can connect to this tethered
      Bluetooth device.
    <h3>Service list</h3>
    <p>The rest of the screen shows the currently available network services.
      You can force a rescan by pressing the <i>Rescan</i> button, this will
      cause Wifi networks to be searched.
    <p>In the service list the colors indicate following status:
      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	      <a href="#" class="connected-online"></a>
	  </td>
	  <td>
	      The service is connected to Internet (Online)
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	      <a href="#" class="connected-ready"></a>
	  </td>
	  <td>
	    The service is connected but Internet connection cannot be
	    confirmed (Ready)
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	      <a href="#" class="not-connected"></a>
	  </td>
	  <td>
	    The service is currently not connected but it is known and
	    connectable (Idle)
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	      <a href="#" class="not-connected-vpn"></a>
	  </td>
	  <td>
	    The VPN service is currently not connected but it is
	    connectable (Idle)
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	      <a href="#" class="unknown"></a>
	  </td>
	  <td>
	    The service is not known i.e., it is currently not provisioned.
	    If you want to connect to it, you must know credentials to access
	    it.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	      <a href="#" class="connect-failed"></a>
	  </td>
	  <td>
	    The last connection attempt to this service failed.
	    If the service is known one, then the auto-connect is temporarily
	    turned off for this service.
	    If the service was unknown and you tried to connect to it, you
	    probably supplied invalid credentials and the connection attempt
	    failed.
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>
      <p>You can edit some parameters of a known service. The service
	becomes known if you have successfully connected to it once.
	Just select the service link righ of the colored status light.
